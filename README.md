## üåü Executive Summary

This project transforms unstructured customer feedback into actionable business intelligence. By analyzing over 17,000 hotel reviews, we identified critical service areas and developed a model to automate the classification of future reviews, enabling management to proactively address guest concerns.

| Business Problem | Technical Solution | Key Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Inability to quantify key themes from thousands of text reviews. | **NLP with TF-IDF and Machine Learning models.** | **Logistic Regression** model achieved **87% accuracy** in classifying review sentiment. |

## üí° Top 3 Actionable Insights

The analysis revealed specific, recurring themes in guest feedback that directly impact satisfaction scores.

| Key Driver | Common Feedback | Business Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Service Quality** | "check-in," "staff," "rude" | Implement targeted staff training programs focused on improving front-desk efficiency and guest interaction protocols. |
| **2. Room Condition** | "dirty," "old," "small" | Prioritize a budget for room renovations and enhance housekeeping quality assurance checks. |
| **3. Positive Drivers** | "location," "breakfast," "lounge" | Leverage these strengths in marketing campaigns to highlight key differentiators and attract new guests. |
